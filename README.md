This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# TODO list:
* [X] change `sanity` content type/update types in project
* [X] write content 
* [X] add cv to
* [ ] update `project` section (restyle)
* [X] styles nits 
* [ ] update next to v13
* [ ] update `README.md` file 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
``` 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
